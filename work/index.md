## Wrote meeting agendas... {#leadership}

## Crunched some numbers... {#data-science}

{: .list-plus}
- **Conducted a randomized field experiment** on whether using photos in text messaging campaigns increased click-through rate, with implications for text message marketing. We found no significant effect of including a picture versus not including one. We used `Twilio` (via Python API) to send SMS messages, `Rebrandly` (via Python API) to generate unique trackable links, and `R` for analysis and visualization.

- **Analyzed student body survey results on grading systems during the COVID-19 shutdown**, comparing student support for Universal Pass versus Opational Pass/Fail and assessing barriers that students face at home [Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ltuBAJO32H4yhcteUkkrn4tuyvTjW2lu/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank" class="button inline-label-page"}


## Researched policy issues and more... {#social-science}

{: .list-plus}
- Helped write a report on how to **bring young civic technologists into the public sector** by creating a student loan forgiveness program, a proven model in other fields [Report on inspire2serve.gov](https://inspire2serve.gov/_api/files/343){: class="button inline-label-page" target="_blank"} [Website](https://picturegrants.org/){: class="button inline-label-page" target="_blank"}
- Wrote a brief for Mikie Sherrill's congressional campaign in NJ-11 regarding reversing decades of environmental mismanagement on the Passaic River, including how to hold chemical polluters accountable and enact more equitable flood insurance policy

In addition, I've also used final projects and essays in several courses as an opportunity to learn more about specific issues I'm interested in, such as:

{: .list-plus}
- **How Western technology companies facilitate digital authoritarianism by selling surveillance products**, acquiescing to China and Russia's demands, and letting misinformation go unchecked, as well as key considerations for developing policy moving forward
- **Whether cyberwarfare will require a fundamental reframing of our understanding of national security** (my take: it won't), and breaking down the key components of the "cyber revolution" hypothesis
- **The potential for algorithmic bias in Sidewalk Labs' proposal for a smart city in Toronto**, how that bias would harm vulnerable populations, and how algorithmic oversight boards can help mitigate these harms
- **The debate over the European Union Copyright Directive**, including an analysis of how key tradeoffs and incentives differ among technology companies, news organizations, and EU regulators. Includes sentiment analysis of tweets from American and European users.

- **How the urban built environment can impact residential segregation**, along with a framework, data sources, and methodology that we can use to study this relationship in New York City
- **How to increase interoperability of electronic health records (EHRs)** in the United States in order to facilitate big data in drug research, precision medicine and patient-centered care

These are notes I've compiled for courses I've taken, as a study and review tool. Feel free to use at your own discretion, although I make no guarantees for the accuracy of the notes or the degree to which they will represent the course as taught in future semesters.

**Map of hubs of US Big Three airline companies**: 

- Current as of December 2018, but Delta has since designated Boston (BOS) as a hub, and established focus city operations Austin (AUS), Nashville (BNA), and San Jose (SJC). Now, nobody knows what will happen to the majors hubs post-coronavirus.
