## Wrote meeting agendas... {#leadership}

## Crunched some numbers... {#data-science}

## Figured out Chicago citations... {#social-science}

In addition, I've also used final projects in several courses as an opportunity to learn more about specific issues I'm interested in:

- **How Western technology companies facilitate digital authoritarianism by selling surveillance products**, acquiescing to China and Russia's demands, and letting misinformation go unchecked, as well as key considerations for developing policy moving forward <span class="inline-label-note">PLSC 455 Big Data & Russian Politics</span>
- **Whether cyberwarfare will require a fundamental reframing of our understanding of national security** (my take: it won't), and breaking down the key components of the "cyber revolution" hypothesis <span class="inline-label-note">GLBL 275 International Security</span>
- **The potential for algorithmic bias in Sidewalk Labs' proposal for a smart city in Toronto**, how that bias would harm vulnerable populations, and how algorithmic oversight boards can help mitigate these harms <span class="inline-label-note">GLBL 395 Data Governance</span>
- **The debate over the European Union Copyright Directive**, including an analysis of how key tradeoffs and incentives differ among technology companies, news organizations, and EU regulators. Includes sentiment analysis of tweets from American and European users. <span class="inline-label-note">CPSC 184 Intellectual Property</span>
- **How the urban built environment can impact residential segregation**, along with a framework, data sources, and methodology that we can use to study this relationship in New York City <span class="inline-label-note">PLSC 211 Social Policy & Inequality</span>
- **How to increase interoperability of electronic health records (EHRs)** in the United States in order to facilitate big data in drug research, precision medicine and patient-centered care <span class="inline-label-note">MCDB 060 Science & Politics of Cancer</span>

**Map of hubs of US Big Three airline companies**: Current as of December 2018, but Delta had since grown Boston (BOS) into a hub, and established focus city operations Austin (AUS), Nashville (BNA), and San Jose (SJC).
